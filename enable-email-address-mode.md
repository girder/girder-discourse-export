# Enable email address mode?

I’d like to use this Discourse instance as though it’s just a mailing list. JC pointed me to the Slicer instance, where this feature is enabled ([https://discourse.slicer.org/t/what\-is\-the\-slicer\-discourse\-e\-mail\-address/1329](https://discourse.slicer.org/t/what-is-the-slicer-discourse-e-mail-address/1329)).


What does it take to do it for this instance, and who has the power to do it?


Thanks!


roni
