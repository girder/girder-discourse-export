Hi [@wangcuiting](/u/wangcuiting),


The recommanded method is explained here : [https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user\-guide.html?highlight\=api%20key\#api\-keys](https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html?highlight=api%20key#api-keys).  

You need to log in a user account, then go to the “My account” page and click the “API keys” tab where you can manage them.


You can also manually generate an API key for a given user using this module: [https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api\-docs.html\#module\-girder.models.api\_key](https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-docs.html#module-girder.models.api_key).


Good luck !
