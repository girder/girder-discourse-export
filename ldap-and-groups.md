# LDAP and Groups

## nicholsn on 2018-03-01T16:04:34.550Z

After a little tweaking of the LDAP plugin, I am able to automatically register new users that are in LDAP (PR to come).


Does the plugin also support LDAP/AD groups for authorization?

It doesn’t at this time, but that would be a nice feature to add!

Hi all,


are there any news on this? Does girder now support ldap groups?


Cheers,  

Alex
