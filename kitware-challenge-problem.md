This submission has been queued for ten hours. Is there something wrong with the platform?

Hi [@jia\_Zhao](/u/jia_zhao),


I apologize for some of the delays you encountered when getting your submission scored. Our Covalic platform hosts several different challenges, one of which had a very high volume of work over the past week, which did impact the scoring of your own submission.


The good news is that we’ve adjusted the workload that Covalic is handling and you should see much faster scoring of your submissions in the future. I’m also seeing that your submission has completed scoring and is visible on the leaderboard.


If you have any questions or issues in the future, please feel free to contact us.
