# cursor pagination

Hi there,


As anyone performed some cursor pagination with Girder (\-\> pymongo) ?  

Would you mind sharing some tips on how to do it ?  

I notably have a very heavy query (with aggregations) that I would like to paginate and Iâ€™m not sure on how to do it. Getting the right pointers would be helpful.


Thanks,  

Julien.
