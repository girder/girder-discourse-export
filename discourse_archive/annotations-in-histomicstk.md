# Annotations in HistomicsTK

## TerezaSadilova on 2019-09-10T10:36:13.410Z

Hello,  

could you please tell me whether there is any way how to upload already existing ndpa annotations to HistomicsTK? We would like to see the annotations in the pictures.  

Thank you for any suggestions.  

Best regards  

Tereza

If you are on a very recent version of HistomicsTK (from the last month or so), there are controls in the Girder item view to upload annotations:

There is an upload icon at the top right of the the Annotations list.

Hello,


thank you we will try to update our version. But we still have this problem: how to convert ndpa annotations to JSON in the way that Histomics would be able to read it? Any thoughts?


Thank you


Best regards
