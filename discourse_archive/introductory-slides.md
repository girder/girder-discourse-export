# Introductory slides?

## swvanderlaan on 2020-12-29T14:25:33.038Z

Hi,


I am new to `HistomicsTK` and `Girder` and `DSA`. I want to set this up for our data, but first I need to understand how everything works. To this end Iâ€™d like it installed and working on my MacBook Pro. And for me to understand everything it would be great if someone could potentially share a brilliant deck of slides or a video explaining the relation between `HistomicsTK` and `Girder` and `DSA`.


Thanks


Sander

Have you seen the DSA documentation at <https://digitalslidearchive.github.io/digital_slide_archive/> ? It covers the relation between HistomicsTK and Girder.
