# ParaView Glance + Girder

## Zach_Mullen on 2018-07-20T18:27:00.224Z

Hello Girder community,


We’ve recently been developing a data visualization tool called ParaView Glance, and announced its public release yesterday on the Kitware blog.\[1] In addition to building this tool, we also created a Girder plugin that allows the Glance viewer to be launched on data stored in Girder directly from Girder’s data browser by clicking the eye icon. Here is an example folder with some data\[2]. If you encounter any issues, or want to suggest cool new features, feel free to open an issue in our issue tracker for the plugin\[3].


Thanks!


\-Zach
