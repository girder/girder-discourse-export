# girder 3 worker with docker example

## Edern_Haumont on 2019-04-15T13:04:52.265Z

Hello everyone. I am looking into girder workers and launching docker images in particular. I was looking for examples that I could try on my girder 3 installation (with girder 3 plugins).


I found this repo : <https://github.com/girder/interactive_thumbnails>. However, it seems to be written for girder 2\.  

Does someone have an example project using girder workers and docker that is compatible with girder3 ?


Thanks.

I ended up modifying [interactive\_thumbnails](https://github.com/girder/interactive_thumbnails) a bit to make it work on girder 3\.
