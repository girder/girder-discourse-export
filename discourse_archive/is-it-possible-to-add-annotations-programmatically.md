# Is it possible to add annotations programmatically

## rogergenbot on 2021-06-04T11:15:08.924Z

Hi, I am starting to use the tool and so far I am able to make annotations through the web interface and then read them with histomickstk. However I have some annotations that have been done externally and I would like to add them to my dsa collection. Is this doable from histomickstk? is there any example? I can only find examples on reading but not writing them.  

Thanks!

This appears to be a duplicate of [Is it possible to add annotation programmatically · Issue \#902 · DigitalSlideArchive/HistomicsTK · GitHub](https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/HistomicsTK/issues/902). See that issue.
