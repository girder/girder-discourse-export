Hi,


I just want to know, if there would be an official release for HistomicsTK anytime soon?


Best,


Sherif

We donâ€™t issue official releases of HistomicsTK very often. The master branch gets updates which are tested and should always work. The default deployment (using the deploy\_docker.py script) installs the latest master.


HistomicsTK has two main components: the image processing tool kit and the user interface. There is an update of the user interface that switches to Girder 3 that is currently a PR (see <https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/digital_slide_archive/pull/41>). As part of this, the UI code is moving to the HistomicsUI repo. We expect this to be released in the next week or three.

I should also add that the HistomicsTK image processing docker module gets published whenever we merge to master.
