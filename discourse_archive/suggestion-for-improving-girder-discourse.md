# Suggestion for improving Girder discourse

## Jean-Christophe_Fill on 2017-09-08T19:14:56.722Z

You will find here a lot of information on:


* how to configure your instances
* which category makes sense
* how to setup mail mode and tweak associated templates
* changing the “heart” image under post with a “thumb up”
* etc …

Currently we have login with Google, I say we add GitHub. Slicer has added Facebook in addition to these two, I don’t have strong feelings about that one, but if we think it doesn’t hurt anything we can turn it on.


Here is our current entry text:


“”"  

This is a place for Girder users and developers to ask questions and collaborate.


Once you register a user, you can use the “New topic” button to start a new conversation.  

"""


I’d like to change it to this, but I don’t have admin:


“”"  

[Girder](http://girder.readthedocs.io/) is a free and [open source](https://github.com/girder/girder) web\-based data management platform developed by [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/) as part of the [Resonant](http://resonant.kitware.com/) data and analytics ecosystem.


This is a forum for Girder users and developers to ask questions and collaborate.


Once you register a user with email or with existing Google, GitHub or Facebook credentials, you can use the “New topic” button to start a new conversation. You can change your email notification settings through your account profile.

[@Michael\_Grauer](/u/michael_grauer) You are now an admin, that text LGTM.

I have added that text (minus Facebook OAuth because I didn’t want to  

bother) to the pinned welcome message and enabled GitHub OAuth tied to the  

Girder GitHub organization.
