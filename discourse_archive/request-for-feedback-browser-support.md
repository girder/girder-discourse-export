# Request for Feedback: Browser Support

## danlamanna on 2018-06-26T14:53:19.307Z

The Girder team is soliciting feedback from the community in order to determine which browser versions to officially support. After collecting feedback the Girder development team will decide on a set of browsers and versions to officially support and publish that information here.


Weâ€™re particularly interested in hearing about:


* Any unusual or overly restrictive environments you may be deploying Girder to
* Specific browsers, devices, and platforms which you rely on for your Girder deployment


Some useful resources might include:


* <http://gs.statcounter.com/>
* [Usage share of web browsers \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_tables)


To add feedback, please join the discussion below:
