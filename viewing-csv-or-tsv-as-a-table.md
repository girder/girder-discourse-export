# Viewing CSV or TSV as a Table

Is anyone aware of a plugin that supports a table based view of csv or tsv files in girder \- ideally something paginated and sortable?

This is something we have wanted for a while but hadn’t gotten around to. Should be going in soon \- feel free to try it out and make suggestions.
