Hi ,


Is the Candela visualization plugin still compatible with Girder 3, because i end up with error while Girder build.


Thanks  

Vicky

The Candela plugin was deprecated in Girder 3\.0 (released Aug 2019\) and is not maintained for that version.

Okay, Thanks for the info.  

Is there any other way to visualize the CSV/TSV files
